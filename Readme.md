## üõ†Ô∏è How the App Was Built  

### Modular Architecture  
The app is structured into modules (same bundle), making it scalable and maintainable. Each module is designed to be extracted into standalone packages if required.  

### Schemes  
- **Weather - Dev Scheme**: Configured for development. 
- **Weather - Prod Scheme**: Configured for production with optimized configurations.

Each Scheme offer its own URLs, keys, and settings configuration. 

### Design System  
- **Theme Protocol**: Includes two built-in themes, providing a foundation for easy customization.  
- **Reusable Components**: Modular components, including icon customization support, enable UI consistency and flexibility.  

### Custom Networking Module  
- Built from scratch to handle API calls and responses efficiently.  

### Dependency Injection  
- Facilitates loose coupling between components and makes the app more testable and modular.  

### Common Module  
- Houses reusable code shared across feature modules.  

### Utils Module  
- Contains utility functions and helpers for common tasks.  

### Localization  
- Currently supports English, with the capability to extend to other languages.  

### Linting  
- **SwiftLint** is integrated to maintain code quality and adherence to best practices.  

### Unit Testing  
- Utilizes **XCTest** for unit testing.  
- Tests are executed automatically on pushes to the `dev` branch.

## üß† Design Patterns  

The app employs several well-known design patterns:  
- **MVVM**: Ensures a clear separation of concerns and reactive state management.  
- **Dependency Injection**: Simplifies testing and promotes modularity.  
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstracts data sources for seamless integration.  
- **Factory Pattern**: Facilitates dynamic object creation based on app needs.

## üöÄ Getting Started  

1. Clone the repository.  
2. Open the project (`Weather.xcodeproj`) in Xcode.  
3. Choose the desired scheme (`Weather - Dev` or `Weather - Prod`) and build the project.  

---

## üß™ Running Tests  

1. Push changes to the `dev` branch.  
2. Unit tests will automatically run via XCTest.  
3. Review results in the Xcode report navigator.
